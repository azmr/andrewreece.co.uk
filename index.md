## Personal Projects

### Programming
With the help of YouTube, friends and books, I have taught myself to program in a number of languages. Here are a few example projects:
- [Geometer](https://github.com/azmr/geometer) - *(in progress)* a simple drawing program (made in C) to replicate construction with a compass and straightedge.
- [Twinstick Sumo](https://github.com/azmr/twinstick-sumo) - a game made in C over 2 days using an engine built 'from scratch'. The objective is to push your opponent out of the ring by bumping into them and throwing things at them. Covers basic graphics, 1- or 2-player user input, collision detection, AI...
- [Tarmak-CLI](https://github.com/azmr/tarmak-cli) - a script for creating the intermediate key layouts used for learning Colemak.
- [Shift-Swap](https://github.com/azmr/shift-swap) - a script for changing around keys (numbers/symbols, square brackets/curly braces, escape/caps lock/ctrl) for CLI keyboard layouts.
- [TimeThis](https://github.com/azmr/timethis) - simple C-based timer to be used on Windows similarly to `time` on Unix (compile times, program execution etc).
- [WebToPDF](https://github.com/azmr/webtopdf) - a server (that can run locally), written in Go, to find images at a URL and make a PDF from them.

### Photography
I've taken over 10,000 photos of gymnasts competing, mostly from the Loughborough club. Here are a few of my favourites:

![Gymnastics pommel flare](img/Gym4.jpg)
![Gymnastics synchronised straight back](img/Gym5.jpg)
![Gymnastics Tkatchev](img/Gym1.jpg)

### Leatherwork
I make belts, bags, knife sheaths, notebooks and wrist pads (among other things) in the leatherworking I set up:
![Leather belt](img/Leather1.jpg)
![Leather bag](img/Leather2.jpg)
![Leather knife sheaths](img/Leather3.jpg)
![Leather notebooks](img/Leather4.jpg)
![Leather wrist pads](img/Leather5.jpg)
